### 1. Introduction to Password Cracking

**Concept:** Understanding hash functions and common cracking methods



**Exercise:** Generate SHA1 hash for `Academy#2025`
```bash
echo -n "Academy#2025" | sha1sum
```
![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/2.PNG)

**Result:** `750fe4b402dc9f91cedf09b652543cd85406be8c`

**Key Takeaway:** Hash functions are one-way operations, but weak passwords remain vulnerable to cracking attempts.

### 2. John the Ripper Proficiency






**Exercise 1:** Single-crack mode for r0lf's password
```bash
john --single hashfile.txt
```
![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/3.PNG)

**Result:** `NAITSABES`





**Exercise 2:** Wordlist attack on RIPEMD-128 hash
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=ripemd-128 hashfile.txt
```

![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/4.PNG)

**Result:** `50cent`





### 3. Hashcat Mastery

**Exercise 1:** Dictionary attack on MD5 hash
```bash
echo "e3e3ec5831ad5e7288241960e5d4fdb8" > hash.txt
john --format=raw-md5 hash.txt
```

![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/5.PNG)

**Result:** `crazy!`





**Exercise 2:** Rule-based attack with best64 rules
```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

**Technical Note:** Required switching to HTB machine due to Kali VM memory limitations (2GB RAM insufficient for GPU-accelerated cracking , i advise you if you gonna work with kali or other distro from your own machine give it at least 4 or 6 GB of RAM)

**Result:** `c0wb0ys1`





**Exercise 3:** Mask attack implementation

![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/9.PNG)
**Result:** `Mouse5!`






### 4. Custom Wordlists and OSINT Techniques

**Concept:** Leveraging organizational and personal information for targeted attacks
**Exercise:** Crack organization-specific password

![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/11.PNG)
![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/12.PNG)
**Result:** `Baseball1998!`





### 5. Protected Files Cracking

**Exercise:** Decrypt password-protected document
![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/13.PNG)
![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/14.PNG)

**Result:** `beethoven`

**Historical Analysis:** Discovered previous password: `L0veme`





### 6. Protected Archives Analysis

**Exercise:** Crack VHD file password protection
```bash
# Hash extraction from VHD file
# Hashcat cracking implementation
```

**Result:** `francisco`






### 7. Network Services Authentication Attacks

**Exercise 1:** WinRM Service Compromise
- **Tools:** CrackMapExec, evil-winrm
- **Credentials Found:**

![alt text](screenshots/Password-Attacks/18.PNG)
- **Flag Captured:** `HTB{That5Novemb3r}`





**Exercise 2:** SSH Service Breach
```bash
crackmapexec ssh 10.129.131.108 -u username.list -p password.list
```
- **Credentials:** `dennis:rockstar`
- **Flag Captured:** `HTB{Let5R0ck1t}`




**Exercise 3:** RDP Service Access
- **Credentials:** `chris:789456123`
